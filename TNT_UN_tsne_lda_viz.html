their fertility by decades of rice irrigation and heavy rainfall with ferri liners and adequate water however many soils are still highly productive in the central and southern portions of the west coast which is the grain basket of the island the soils are primarily red and yellow latrines require ing care in farming but giving satisfactory production under the careful management practised by chinese farmers although upland soils are thin and only poor to fair they produce abundant tree and subtropical growth owing to the continuous growing season and heavy rainfall soil erosion processes are rapid in the hills and mountains where vegetation is removed because of the torrential rains and rugged topography a serious problem is the temporary cultivation of unbelievably steep slopes by mountain people and aborigines who burn off the plant cover of new areas every two or three years it is under stood that this is illegal and that an effort is being made to teach these people terracing and good conservation practices the practice is widespread however and is certainly one of the reasons that soil erosion processes are more rapid than soil forming processes in taiwan

equipment this special fund engineer encouraged and conducted joint meetings with the staffs of all three aboratories at which the more important work of each laboratory was freely discussed and information and findings exchanged this is believed to be a major contribution to the development of ivan s hydraulic laboratories and proved so successful that the respective staffs agreed to hold similar seminars on a regular basis and to co operate fully with each other in order to avoid duplication of effort it vas further agreed to work out study areas for which each laboratory would be primarily responsible though not rigidly restricted thereto it is of course necessary that the university laboratories be prepared to give comprehensive student instruction and training but it was agreed that it would be feasible to deli neat for them fields of model studies in order to avoid the duplication of costly equipment and permit greater concentration on specific problems there is an

and staffed to permit the solution of some current hydraulic problems in addition to carrying out their primary function of instructing students in hydraulics these laboratories although in need of additional equipment and plant have a good potential for expansion to meet the requirements of the immediate future they have done and should continue to carry out applied studies and basic research while main training their instructional functions  hydraulic laboratories on ivan are not now adequate to cope with the many applied problems in the design of hydraulic development projects there

experts and their conclusions summary of each category of work covered by the experts is given full reports of the in this chapter along with the conclusions reached the experts are printed in volume ii to which reference should be made for more detailed information  the members of the team adopted a broad and general interpretation of the agreement and plan of operation and their activities were not limited to the items and areas specifically mentioned therein multi purpose river basin planning of work  the plan of operation specified pre investment planning and survey work on multi purpose projects on the choshui river in central taiwan and the penn river in south western taiwan in addition the chinese agencies and officials were particularly interested in multi purpose projects on the tsengwen pain and other rivers in an effort to meet the requirements of the republic of ch in and satisfy the desires of the several agencies concerned with hydraulic development projects all of these areas were visited and are commented on in chapter  of volume  thus the report covers the five largest rivers in taiwan for multi purpose basin studies and individual multi purpose projects on several other rivers these drainage basins with their large deltas on the west coast total over half the area of the island in all cases recommend nations projects from further study or for advancing projects to the next stage of plan king joint staff meetings prior to and following field inspection trips so that appropriate suggestions could be made to the engineers concerned mental organization required the preparation of reports and office and field procedures discussed in joint staff meetings and in conferences with the staffs of the various agencies in summary it may be said that river basin planning covered all accessible areas of the island aerial surveys were made of several of the inaccessible headwater areas of the more important basins and additional headwater reconnaissance was recommended for areas on which there is now little or no information these surveys will require opening trails and constructing overnight camping sites in the rugged mountain areas of taiwan were made for further reconnaissance surveys for eliminating certain where reports had been made by chinese engineers they were relieved in the govern conclusions  one of the most serious handicaps in implementing hydraulic development projects in the republic of china is the lack of co ordination between more or less competing agencies of the government this is evident from the collection of basic information to the promotion and actual construction of projects competitive use of water no one centre or agency exists where all of information are known not to mention the information itself after for some time without required data team members to dear the sources king n that such data did exist in an unexpected place similar confusion have continually been surprised ","has been noted between separate agencies and interests in the demand for use of water more water is demanded for rice irrigation for sugar cane multi nation and for converting dry crop lands at the same time an ambitious pro gramme of promoting industrial development which will require large increases in industrial water supplies is being vigorously pushed by the government and last but certainly not least domestic water supplies require supplementing or developing throughout most of the island it is encouraging to report that the government representative who is chairman of the water resources planning commission wept is well aware of this situation and has promoted seminars and periodic meetings that bring together personnel of the university staff and various agencies for the exchange of ideas and information the special fund team participated in these meetings and urged that they be continued in the interest of eliminating duplication of effort and waste it is concluded that in these areas the wept if given federal status and a definite annual budget could serve a most useful purpose constituted as it is by represent natives of all agencies concerned with the use of water and the development of hydraulic projects it would be in a position with strong government support to serve as an inter agency co ordinating administration that could prevent waste and objectively weigh the several demands for and uses of water  in addition to the equipment furnished by this special fund project the team members have located considerable equipment furnished by the international co operation administration ice or other entities that was stored in warehouses the government representative requires his staff to inventory all equipment and is trying to place it where it will be put to proper use this is of peri mary importance in order that realistic estimates may be made of the needed additional equipment and in some cases of the related equipment required to make full use of items already on hand  the objective of integrated multi purpose river basin development is to determine a the water resources potential of a basin or region b the engineering and economic feasibility of developing this potential and c the integration of projects to make the optimum use of this potential equitably distributed to all uses of water resources the enthusiasm with which this approach has been adopted by the government representative and his staff in lieu of the single project single purpose single area approach is gratifying to the team and will result in greatly improved developments in the republic of china  there is an urgent need for the collection and compilation of reliable basic data in a systematic and uniform manner in taiwan and for agencies which have collected data for their own use to share such information the government representative realizes this need and with the full co operation and consultation of the team has initiated the establishment of an island wide network of base and secondary stations supplemented by project stations as required for the collection of basic data care is being taken to co ordinate this activity with related work of other agencies so as to avoid duplication  the tendency to initiate detailed design with inadequate field connais since or preliminary examination should be discouraged ","d contra average

study of earlier re ports and joint staff meetings with planning personnel disclosed that the approach to planning a reservoir often vas first to determine the amount of later required to mprove rice

largely on a single purpose single project and single are basis which did not take into account other equally m portent uses athough frequently due to the pressures of influential group interested in one specific use t vas primarily moving to the lack of strong planning organizations with adequate authority both to plan and to set is impartial review boards on single agency plans it is in this area that the water resources planning commission wept can be of great service to the republic of china  the objective of planning should be to make the best possible use and re use of water for all purposes from the time and place where it falls upon the land unti it reaches the ses as surface or underground later to sccomplsh the planning has to be undertaken on basin wide basis and sometimes on a regional basis involving contiguous basins it is m portent that local officials as vell as provincial and national govern men representatives have an effective voice in this action which must

land reclamation in upper areas can be combined with the protection and erosion control  run off could be regulated on tablelands and especially at the escape cents where the rivers have cut their beds longitudinal drainage ditches and marginal dikes could intercept the flow before t reaches the steep slope in the terrace formations the collected water could be led down in paved gullies and possibly part could be retained to infiltrate into the terrace deposits the slopes proper could be safeguarded by horizontal drainage at dangerous points or there valuable land would be protected by this measure such possibilities seem worth investigation as they might afford substantial relief  check gems might also provide appreciable relief although the geology of the island is not favourable to these structures it is not ikely that many check dams could be justified in terrace formations  in the future veter vill become very valuable as a commodity for nidus trial and domestic water

proficient in sedimentation control with the full coeur hence of the government and the executing agency it vas decided to have this expert handle both subjects over a period of one year rather than to recruit to experts each for six months the heavy burden of sediment carried by most of ivan s rivers poses one of the most serious problems in the development of its later resources while a number of things contribute to this condition including abuses by man the primary causes are the physics graphic and climate conditions of ivan over which man has little or no control the deposition of this sediment seriously reduces the capacity of reservoirs shortens the life of hydro electric generating equipment and requires large expenditures annually to remove it from irrigation canals it is of the utmost importance therefore that all practicable measures be taken to reduce and control this natural phenomenon not the least of which is the institution and enforcement of good watershed management practices very little data have been collected on sediment production transport and deposit the special fund expert on this subject recommended the establish men of primary and secondary stations at specific locations for the collection of reliable data held a number of conferences on approved methods of collect ing and analyzing such days and made a number of field trips to direct surveys for determining the more severe production dress in addition to advising on the investigation programme he delivered several lectures on structures designed to retard sediment production and transport and on the means of flush ing it from existing or planned hydraulic structures conclusions  strict attention should be given to sedimentation control in all planning in order that problems may be defined and solved to the maximum practicable extent prior to completion of definite project plans  existing sediment conditions should be dealt with on an island wide basis rather than at scattered unrelated locations to produce area wide data and permit delineation of the over all problems  maximum use should be made of all data and facilities including hydraulic laboratories and accepted design procedures should be followed for obtaining realistic and economical solutions to the sediment problem  the hope should serve as a supervising agency for the uniform and sys tetanic collection analyss filing and publication of all basic days on sediment behaviour sediment production  studies should be made and maps prepared to define present and potential areas of erosion and the degree of severity to be expected in each  investigations should be made on an island wide basis to determine the relative amounts of sediment produced by each of the erosional processes ","minuted of the th meeting of

this development and after upstream storage is available on the choshui and excess water is diverted from the we river it is proposed to use chichi as a re regulating dam and to construct another irrigation canal to the south this canal would carry from  to  cubic metes per second   to   cubic feet per second and would require a siphon under the chingshui river and a tunnel through the

briefly summarizes the which dem and chichi common diversion proposals several variations of these plans have been stud red by the wept staff and the special fund team has reviewed these plans and made appropriate field examinations the wept reports clearly show the need for continuing studies of these ambitious proposals with a view to reducing costs by the elimination of some of the more expensive items such as the long siphons across either the choshui or the chingshui rivers or both preliminary economic analyses show that none of the al alternatives proposed to date can be justified for irrigation alone nor can they be equitably carried by the relatively smal amount of over which can be developed in the diversion canals it is apparent there fore that the plans can be justified

at the water resources planning commission wept the latest sum mary of the preliminary reports contemplated over  kilometre  miles of diversion canals and tunnels for inter basin and intra basin conveyance this is believed to be excessive and it has been suggested that this feature be carefully reconsidered with a view to eliminating most if not all of the tunneng in general it is more efficient to make use of later resources in the river and basin where they originate if the benefits can be derived in that basin long tunnels are expensive and may be difficult to maintain in a faulted and active seismic area unfortunately the approach in this earlier planning has been to estimate the water requirements of existing developments and to seek dem sites that would impound this requirement rather than to study the water resources potential of the basin as a whole and plan for the optimum use of these resources for all purposes as sta ted previously the wept is now using the latter approach which will result n more comprehensive basin studies although this basin enjoys abundant rainfall in the wet season the seasonal distribution is such that serious water shortages develop in the planting season when the precipitation is low and almost the entire natural low of the river is diverted for irrigation there are potential dam sites on all four of the principal tributaries of the knowing river but sufficient geological explorations have not been made to prove any of the sites or to determine the height and type of dam unquestionably irrigation power development later supply and flood control are purposes that could be served by integrated development in this basin two smal hydro plants are in exist once and a number of kilometre of dikes and levees have been constructed in the central and lower portion of the basin in an effort to provide some flood control close meandering secondary channels and to improve river regimen a reasonable control has been attained over the lover river in the past year a ground later investigation team has been working in the basin and a report on this sub jest is now in preparation these operations have not been correlated and a basin wide study has not been possible owing to the lack of reliable basic data mary rainfall stations are concentrated in the plains and lovlands but there are none in the higher lands and mountains the existing stations are not properly shielded from the wind and a number of them are no longer in use  the special fund team has made an aerial survey of the headwaters of the knowing to observe dam sites that vere otherwise inaccessible several trips have been made to accessible dam sites for ground inspection and to examine other possibilities for development these trips have served to con since the team further of the potentialities of this basin but much basic work and planning will be required if there s to be vel co ordinated develop men the latest summary report of preliminary investigations in this basin vas based on very little reliable basic data on stream flow and no estimate n probable flood with the exception of three holes one admit and to inspection pits at the tulungwan dam site no subsurface geological investigations have been made in the basin  the latest report roughly estimates the hydro electric over development possibiities to be over   kilowatts and shows a definite need for domestic and industrial later supplies flood control and irrigation in addition to other uses pollution abatement and recreation are

maintained and gradually extended over a period of years this work has a somewhat lower priority than the reservoirs but should be planned so as to provide flood control and ultimately confine the

thoroughly covered by the expert in general and with regard to specific rivers and locations he also gave a series of lectures on flood control methods and developed some ingenious methods of correlating and correcting limited basic data so as to give reasonably accurate results it is significant that in practically every instance where these amputations were applied the estimate of the maximum probable flood was substantially increased conclusions  rainfall in taiwan is heavy the average is  milmetres per annum and has a very uneven distribution in area and in time a large portion of the yearly rain falls during a few concentrated storms notably during typhoons the upper reaches of rivers have a very rapid run off flood volumes are high with sharp peaking peaks with   per cent frequency per annum are about  cubic metes per second per square kilometre in the largest basins the lower reaches are flat with low capacity inundations in alluvial plains are frequent the rivers carry a heavy sediment load on the western plains the bed load moves in low waves and the river sections change very slowly over the course of years on the eastern plains there are many areas where contain vous aggravation has reached several metes in a decade rendering levees and bridges inadequate in the rivers of the eastern part bed load moves in large mounds who and ensuing floods could be lessened or eliminated by stabilizing the rivers with training works damage has often reached catastrophic proportions most of the cultivated land is on the alluvial plains and more than a quarter of it is in the danger zone in recent years annual losses have averaged  people dead or missing and  million it in property damage including the damage to about  hectares of cultivated land existing works will prevent some of the damage which occurred in these years major catastrophes however are still possible ich may cause seasonal bed changes of several metes aggravation  practically all flood control on the island is achieved by  kilometre of levees twenty five hundred spur dikes are used mainly as scour protection works with negligible effect on river training many of the confining works are at the same time parts of reclamation projects the degree of protection provided is too low to develop prosperity and the risk of failure uneconomi call high in the past years large expenditures for relief have been necks say boulder beds with large relative roughness shoaling and meandering have complicated hydraulic analyses sudden floods and tidal effects have made static backwater computations inapplicable many design data will be needed on stages discharges currents river hydrography and hydrology con miserable information can be obtained by a re examination of existing records  limited reservoir storage only is justified at present and in these li ted reservoirs flood control interests are in some conflict with power irrigation and water supply developments optimum water resources utilization will give the maximum benefits control of floods by retention cannot be expected in the near future so flood control on the island should continue to be achieved by levees

included here on a deep vell turbine pump rays ing or lovering the impeller blades slightly within their bowls can alter the production rates the installation of a high lift pump may not increase the yield from a vell but may produce a decided saving in kilovatt consume ton the use of a submersible pump of lower efficiency than a vertical turbine may have other offsetting advantages such as no housing being re quired no danger of flood damage or annual operating hours being so few that lover efficiency is not as critical as initial cost these and other factors related to operation and ultimate cost coupled with changing conditions within the aquifers require that continued study and observation of vell development projects be maintained from a hydro geological a mechanical and an economic point of view the maintenance of optimum operation practices in regard to these conditions vill preserve the water resource indefinitely and at the some time preserve an economically sound development project pump testing  in pump tests by the pgdp the practice has been to use one wel in determining storage and transmissibility coefficients there may be advance takes in changing this system and rather than pumping and making hand taped measurement of the fall in water level at the same time in the same vel one or two observation wells might be drilled  to  feet from the pumping well these should be on a line through the pumping well perpendicular to the direction of movement of the ground later good elevation control and the use of automatic recorders in the observation wells and air line level measurements in the pumping well ensure further accuracy using this method a truer shape of the dravdown cone may be determined in particular areas fever tests should produce more representative results  the practice of using a battery of four to six smal diameter bamboo cells in a circular pattern all pumped by one centrifugal pump is question able for such tests particularly with regard to obtaining accurate water levels during the pumping and to maintaining uniform pumping rates  one should be extremely conservative in making estimates of well yield if the preliminary estimate is higher than the actual yield this figure may plague one for years even for a good vell while if the estimate is too low there are no complaints guaranteeing product ion rates prior to drilling the well is a hazardous business in reports submitted for publication all reference to estimated yield for individual wells should be eliminated if possible in addition the use of tested yield figures can often lead to misinterpretation it is better to postpone the use of these figures until the actual yield based upon production records can be obtained test drilling  small diameter hole test drilling prior to construction of large capacity irrigation wells is highly recommended when subsurface conditions are not vell known these wells can provide much valuable information from geological sampling and electrical logging of the aquifers but may give only an india ton of the production potential on pump testing if the suffers are not productive however this

measurement preferably sealed later meters should be installed on each vell for water fee purposes and to give accurate pro suction records for annual yield calculations these meters which fit on eight inch discharge ines and register about  gallons per minute should sell for approximately u s  on the world market legal penalties for tampering with these meters should be established and

a generally accepted fact that when water is metered the consumer is much less wasteful of the water supply water conservation through education is to be desired but it is not as effective as conservation through economic or legal necessity  in the past vell locations have been selected by the irrigation also nations in consultation with the pgdp primary consideration has been given to

water resources planning commission which is planned as a national institution to be con turned primarily with model experiments for projects proposed or under con destruction was in an early stage of development the two other hydraulic laboratories on the island one at the national taiwan university and the other at the provincial when king university were in a more advanced stage of development and were of necessity being used for project model studies as well as student training laboratories the work of the three laboratories was not co ordinated in addition to supervising the layout of buildings and equipment for the wept laboratory and giving a number of lectures on the still nation of equipment this special fund engineer encouraged and conducted joint meetings with the staffs of all three laboratories at which the more important work of each laboratory was freely discussed and information and findings exchanged this is believed to be a major contribution to the development of taiwan s hydraulic laboratories and proved so successful that the respective staffs agreed to hold similar seminars on a regular basis and to co operate fully with each other in order to avoid duplication of effort it was further agreed to work out study areas for which each laboratory would be primarily responsible though not rigidly restricted thereto it is of course necessary that the university laboratories be prepared to give comprehensive student instruction and training but it was agreed that it would be feasible to deli neat for them fields of model studies in order to avoid the duplication of costly equipment and permit greater concentration on specific problems there is an urgent need for these facilities to be made fully operative at the early est date possible to aid in the solution of hydraulic problems that are not readily susceptible of mathematical solutions conclusions  because engineering hydraulics is not an exact science there is a fund mental need for hydraulic laboratories for basic study to broaden the available knowledge to assist in the training of students in hydraulics and to find solutions to applied problems in hydraulic design  the two university laboratories are equipped and staffed to permit the solution of some current hydraulic problems in addition to carrying out their primary function of instructing students in hydraulics these laboratories although in need of additional equipment and plant have a good potential for expansion to meet the requirements of the immediate future they have done and should continue to carry out applied studies and basic research while main training their instructional functions  hydraulic laboratories on taiwan are not now adequate to cope with the many applied problems in the design of hydraulic development projects there is therefore an urgent need for a central hydraulic laboratory the emerging wept hydraulic laboratory can be developed to meet many of these current and future requirements need for major expansion of this laboratory and or est banishment of others will depend on the rate of hydraulic development in the country in the years to come ","draft united nations

status of site planning and exploration  in view of the increased number of sites requiring exploration the imited funds available for such work and the shortage of qualified end peering geologists in

ivan a permanent solution of the flood control problem requires combating heavy deposits sediment data are necessary for design on mary rivers since stability has not been achieved continuous deposition has developed dangerous conditions near the mouths of the alien chi and laying chi retaining works have imited the area for mutual chi silting and within this area aggravation has proceeded at such a rapid rate that over flow would have very serious consequences t several reclamation projects are possible in the middle reaches of the alien and hatululuan chi and their tributaries and on the laying plain very few of these schemes appear profitable at present although some may become feasible in the future in the projects are implemented sediment deposits can no longer be permitted at the works some fine sediment could be channelled possibly to build up the land and to supply fine material to the adjacent fields but heavy sediment must be carried out of the reclaim ton regions  the present rate of deposition at the river outfalls from the mountains and in the alien waiting rift valley is not known but indications are that the addition of this quantity to the present river sediment load will be significant if reclamation projects are attempted here the lower reaches mist be confined in the near future with drastic reduction of width at bed building discharges in some areas it may be advisable to create a confined channel for the rivers between to walls built to maximum flood heights  the suggested works would offer the additional benefit of relieving the adequate drainage in the alien chi valley upstream of the mutual chi con influence where some existing reclaimed areas are vaterlogged the confined river will cut a deeper channel after the training works are built and the normal water table should be covered training methods to a series of spur dikes have been built recently but most are short and are basically toe protection works there are some on the

tributaries have very steep gradients through narrow gorges landslide on the tributaries are rather frequent and the streams are heavily burdened with sediment and boundary debris at med sum and high

kilometre over trails along the layer to inspect a number of potent till dam sites the lumen site which is the farthest upstream of the sites proposed by the chinese engineers is located in a narrow gorge the precipitous and overhanging sides of this gorge are composed of feathered fractured and in spots rotten slate which could be dislodged very easily it is apparent that if such a slip started it would completely fill the gorge a landsip of lesser proportions occurred immediately above the site within the last five years and there is abundant evidence of older slips along this river even if a dam could be successfully built at this location the mil lions of cubic metes of feathered and rotten slate that would have to be scaled off and disposed of under the most difficult conditions would cost more than the dam itself this is only one of the many complex and costly problems that would be involved in the development of this site l the team visited the chingshui site which is a short distance dovnstream er the lungren site and which appears to be far better than the lumen site from a geological standpoint and to involve fever problems thorough geological investigation wil have to

olgocene and miocene and vas accompanied by limited intrusions of ultrabasic rocks and followed by intense faulting epeirogeni c movement probably started early in the pliocene epoch followed by pronounced volcano em and recurrent faulting at the beginning of the quaternary period the most important volcanic activity of the period took place early in the pleistocene epoch and was localized in north taiwan and the penghu islands in the taiwan strait this activity resulted in fissure eruptions of basalt lava andesite flows acute dikes and extensive deposition of volcanic agglomerate and other wroclastics the early pleistocene is largely responsible for the main phase of diastrophism and brutal defer nation which have formed many of taiwan s present structural and physiographic features a few examples are the lava flows and pyroclastics thick conglom rete deposits lateritic and non lateritic terrace deposits before sub emergence basalt lava erupted through fissures in various parts of the ivan strait some remnants of these eruptions remain today such as the low lying flat penghu islands pescadores off the west coast which are composed largely of plateau basalt the

which is composed of four mountain ranges which divide the island unequally into two perts the concave curvature of the north south longitudinal axis of the island to the east compared with that of the surrounding pacific island ares and chains of islands is coincident with the curvature of the mountain range of western fusion some authorities have utilized this together with other evidence to indicate that taiwan was formerly part of the continent of air ong the flanks of the anticline that forms the main backbone range of the central mountain system there occur belts of scene slate gocene volcanics miocene shale and sand stone piocene shale sandstone and redstone and pleistocene lava flows all of which conform generally with the structural trend of the island the eastern rift valley and the east coast range which borders it on the pacific side also coincide with the trend many of these geologic formations have been slced by thrust faulting into a series of longitudinal belts of

area as well as many kilometre of highways and sugar railroads it has accordingly been eliminated from further consideration in favour of sites further upstream and is thus not shown on the begin map figure  the chiahsien site further upstream does not appear to be suitable for a concrete dam but may be adequate for an earth fil or rock fill dam from surface examination however there appear to be a number of other disadvantages which make it advisable to prospect for other upstream sites before undertaking extensive geological investigations at this location the third site on the nantzuhsien is at mints a relatively narrow gorge which vas viewed from the air but is inaccessible by foot al that can be said about this site is that it looked promising topographically it is believed that one

constructing new projects the chinese engineers had to initiate work without the benefit of extensive planning they have accomplished much since the island was returned to them in  but of necessity works to provide immediate benefits or emergent protection had to be undertaken without comprehensive basin planning in fact reliable basic data on an island side basis so essential to comprehensive

expert in establishing an island wide network of primary secondary and project stations for the collection of basic data essential to the planning of hydraulic developments it was learned that rainfall stations were concentrated in the lower hills and plains and little or no data were being collected in the mountains where rainfall is the heaviest and that gauge were not properly equipped with windshields and many were badly affected by obstructions the resulting errors are cumulative on the low side so that many of the available records were found to be  to  per cent too low in
